CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------

4 page submissions due by Jun 10th, 2021

Healthcare is, traditionally, a knowledge-driven enterprise with an enormous
amount of data - both structured and unstructured. These data can impact
positively on the development of data-driven health care including precision
medicine and precision public health. In recent years, large scale
medical/clinical datasets, such as “omics” data and radiology reports  are
increasingly available. We have also witnessed an increasing number of
successful AI/ML applications using such datasets to address problems such as
drug repurposing and preliminary screening of radiology reports. To facilitate
the adoption of such AI/ML in practice, we have simultaneously witnessed an
increasing adoption/innovation of using explainability methods to
analyze/present AI for Health.  In this deep learning era, What is the current
status of AI/ML applications in healthcare? What are the standard methods of
explaining such AI models for healthcare? What are the roles of causality in
AI/ML practices?  What are the state-of-the-art developments in causal AI in
health and health care domains?  What are the limitations and how are the
different facets of trust and explanations (see figure 1 below) being addressed
in practice? Can knowledge-backed AI lead to more robust and interpretable
models? How do data scientists and physicians apply this knowledge in
collaboration and via human-centered AI approaches to further the field and
improve healthcare? How are regulatory requirements for transparency and
trustworthiness of models and data privacy being defined and how can they be
fulfilled?
After witnessing so many great achievements from deep learning lately, we
propose to invite world-leading experts from both data science and healthcare
to discuss and debate the path forward for practical applications of AI/ML in
healthcare, including demos, early work, and critiques on the current state and
the path forward for explainability and trustworthiness in AI. More
specifically, we plan to attract high-quality original research from emerging
areas with significant implications in healthcare and invite open discussions
on controversial yet crucial topics regarding healthcare transformation

* User driven XAI in Healthcare
* Trustworthiness
* Uncertainty quantification and communication, e.g. out-of-distribution detection
* Domain generalization and adaptation, e.g. multi-site studies
* Data access, sharing and privacy, e.g. via federated learning
* Human-in-the-loop-learning and human-centered AI
* Synthetic data for healthcare research
* Interpretable healthcare
* Actionable Insights
* Behavioral studies
* Ethical AI and accountability
* Regulatory aspects of AI in healthcare
* Nudging and implications
* Multidisciplinary studies on Healthcare
* Demos of practical applications

Papers must be submitted in PDF format to easychair
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dshealth2021 and formatted according to
the new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. Authors are encouraged to use the Overleaf template (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc).
